## Summary
My time as an account manager and executive have given me the negotiation and communication skills required to close new business as well as navigate the complex landscape of renewals. As a Customer Support Rep or CSM/TAM, I have used those skills as well as my experience to onboard and manage projects for customers as small as individuals and as large as Federal Banks and Jaguar/Land Rover. I'm looking for the next step in my career, another opportunity to leverage all of my skill and experience toward positively impacting customers and helping to raise up the fantastic people I work with.
